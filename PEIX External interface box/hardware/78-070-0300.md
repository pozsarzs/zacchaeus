### About module

_There are no position numbers or other markings printed on the panel._  

The unit is responsible for generating the 5 V DC voltage required to
power the TTL circuits. It also has a low-current power supply output and
a signal connection point. These will be defined later.  

The module uses +24 V (3A) power supply. 


### Jumper settings

There is no jumper setting option on the module.
